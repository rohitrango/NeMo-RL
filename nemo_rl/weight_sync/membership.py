"""Rank layout for a refit communicator rebuilt over the surviving generation shards.

Kept as pure arithmetic, separate from the Ray dispatch that applies it, because this is
the part that has to be exactly right and the part that cannot be exercised on a
workstation: reproducing a shard loss needs at least three GPUs (one trainer and two
generation shards, so that losing one still leaves a fleet). The dispatch is a handful of
``.remote()`` calls; the rank layout is where an off-by-one silently corrupts a refit.

    Here rather than in each synchronizer because both hardened transports need the same
    answer and had the same ten lines, byte for byte. Same reason ``desired_membership``
    is here: the arithmetic is what has to be exactly right, and two copies of a rule is
    the bug class this stack keeps hitting.

    Compared against what was **built**, not against "is anything absent". Keyed off the
    absent set alone this returns False the moment a restarted shard comes back, leaving
    it permanently excluded from a communicator it should rejoin.

    ``force`` is how the recovery path says the communicator is GONE rather than merely
    unchanged: after an abort the membership is identical and the communicator is dead, so
    skipping would retry over nothing.

    It only overrides the skip when something IS absent. Forcing a rebuild with an empty
    absent set would produce a communicator that still contains the rank that just went
    silent, and the retry would hang on it exactly as the first attempt did. That case --
    a frozen-but-alive rank, which never becomes absent -- must fall through to False so
    the caller reports "no generation shard could be identified as absent" and stops.

    Args:
        desired: what the membership should be, given who is absent now.
        built: what the live communicator was actually built over. Callers treat an
            unrecorded membership as the full fleet: ``init_communicator`` builds over
            everything, so "not recorded" is not "unknown", and calling it a difference
            would rebuild pointlessly on the first refit of every run.
        absent_shards: shards currently absent, as the caller sees them.
        force: the caller knows the communicator is gone rather than stale.

    Prefixes are reassigned so the surviving ranks are **contiguous** from the start of

    not cosmetic: the nccl_reshard transport builds its destination device mesh as
    ``torch.arange(rank_offset, rank_offset + num_gpus)``, so a gap would silently
    misalign every parameter's placements. It also matches what ``shrink`` does to a
