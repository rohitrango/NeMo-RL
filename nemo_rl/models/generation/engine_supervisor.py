"""Brings dead generation shards back.

Without this the fleet only shrinks: a shard lost at hour one is gone for the rest of the
run, and a job that sheds a few transient failures ends up permanently smaller. The
recovery path itself already handles both directions -- a rebuild can name more shards
than the last one -- so all that is missing is something to restart the engine and say
when it is ready.

The restart is deliberately *not* awaited by the caller. Reloading a model takes minutes,
and the control loop this runs from also drives the rollout pump, the watchdog and the
refit; blocking it for a restart would stall the training that the surviving shards are
still perfectly able to do.

Handover to the rest of the system is through fleet-health states, not through this class:

    DEAD --(restart starts)--> RESTARTING --(engine up)--> STALE --(next refit)--> HEALTHY

``RESTARTING`` is absent from collectives, so a rebuild that happens mid-restart correctly
leaves the shard out. ``STALE`` is *present* but not serving, which is what lets the next
refit write current weights into it before it takes traffic again.

        whose workers are not daemons and are joined at interpreter exit with no timeout,
        and a worker only checks for the stop sentinel *between* items. A thread parked
        inside a reload never sees it, so the join never returns and the process cannot
        exit. A model reload takes minutes, which makes this the call in the feature most
        likely to be that thread. ``drain`` cannot help: the join happens whether or not
        anyone calls it.

        BOUNDED, because nothing else in the chain is. ``restart_shard`` ends in ``ray.get``
        calls with no timeout, and ``create_worker`` returns *before* the actor is

        the ``except`` above never fires and the shard sits in RESTARTING for the rest of
        the run, never retried because it is no longer DEAD and never retired because
        retirement is driven by restart attempts. Timing out converts that silent park into
        a failed restart that spends an attempt and eventually retires the shard.

        The orphaned thread is a real cost, not a free win: the reload may still be running,
        and if it later succeeds it does so into a fleet that has written the shard off. It
        is bounded by the attempt budget, and the alternative is a shard that disappears.
