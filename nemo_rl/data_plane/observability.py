"""Lean per-op metrics decorator for ``DataPlaneClient``.

Wraps any ``DataPlaneClient`` and invokes a single user-provided
callback on each operation. Each event is a flat dict::

    {"op", "partition_id", "n_keys", "n_bytes", "wall_ms", "status"}

Plug wandb / file logging / debug print at the call site by passing
``on_event=<your function>``. ``snapshot()`` returns cumulative
totals **plus** live memory consumption: ``bytes_outstanding`` (sum of
bytes currently held in TQ, i.e. put minus cleared) and
``peak_bytes_outstanding`` (high-water mark over the run lifetime).

Every method here runs on the hot path of a transfer, so nothing traverses
a structure twice and nothing is allocated for a payload no callback reads.

``verify_tensor_hash=True`` adds an opt-in correctness check: a per-row
``torch.hash_tensor`` fold over each row's values, mixed with its dtype
and shape, recorded at
put and re-checked at get, so a tensor that changes between wire-in and
wire-out is reported rather than trained on. It reads every tensor byte
again on both sides, so it is a debugging tool, not a metric. See
``README.md`` for what it does and does not catch.

    ``torch.hash_tensor`` only implements an XOR fold (``mode=0``), which is

    none of those alter the multiset of element words. Mixing the row's shape
    and dtype into the fold closes all three. It remains blind to a
    permutation *within* a row, which is the price of the fold being
    vectorized; ``README.md`` records that.

    The fold being an XOR is also what lets one algorithm serve both layouts.
    XOR is associative and elementwise, so ``hash_tensor(row)`` equals
    ``hash_tensor(rect, dim=1)[i]`` -- a rectangle reduces in one on-device
    call, a ragged leaf falls back to one call per row, and the two agree

    ``leaf[bounds[i] : bounds[i + 1]]``. ``row_shape`` maps a row's length to
    the shape recorded for it, which is what keeps the jagged and dense views
    of one field agreeing: both must call a row ``(L, D)``.
